    question: "What makes Pulsar OS different from other Linux distributions?",
    answer: "Normal Linux distributions give you only a base and a graphical environment, but many do not even add functionality and very few innovate. Pulsar OS focuses on replicating the look and, very importantly, workflow of the operating systems that people use to offer the good of Linux with the good of, in this case, macOS.",

    question: "Can I install it on my Macbook?",
